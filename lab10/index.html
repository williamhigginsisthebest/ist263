            <p>
                My major is <strong>information management and technology</strong> and the reason why I am interested in this major is because I feel it teaches a good blend between management and technical skills which will help me in the future. Some skills that I know include Python, risk management, and I am trying to learn <strong>Rust</strong> in my free time.

        <h2> Personal Info</h2>

            <p>
                A few of my hobbies include reading, snowboarding, and I am also trying to learn how to ice skate. A fun fact for those interested, the ice skating rink in south campus (Tennity Ice Skating Pavilion) is completely free for students and you just need to sign up for a slot through the wellness portal. One of my favorite tv shows is an older sci-fi show called Farscape.
