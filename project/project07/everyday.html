        <p>Have you ever been using your garbage disposal and have it randomly stop working? You flick the switch and nothing happens but you are sure that it didnâ€™t break and that it is still has power? This tip might help you. On some models of garbage disposals there is this little red button either underneath the unit or on the backside of the unit. When it is not working, you can try to press that button in and it should start up again. If the garbage disposal is not working properly but you can hear it making a faint sort of sound, make sure that nothing is stuck inside of it. Turn the garbage disposal off and then check for any spoons or bits of plastic that could stop it from running properly. Once you have removed those obstructions, you can turn the unit back on and use it like normal. </p>

        <p>When living in a snowy place that uses salt for the roads, make sure that you go to a car wash every once and a while (and select the undercarriage wash option) in order to clear off some of the salt build up on your car. This will help prevent the car from rusting from all the salt water that is sitting on your car. </p>

        <p>Important note: If your car was originally from a hotter state, be careful when exiting a car wash in cold temperatures. The glass may break if it cools down too fast since the glass is not used to the temperature differences.</p>
